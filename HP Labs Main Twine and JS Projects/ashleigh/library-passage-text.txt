You've arrived in what appears to be a sun room,
though most of the sun is blocked by bookshelves that span from floor to ceiling. 
The room can't be larger than a studio apartment, but the shelves live in a surpsingly maze-like arrangement. 
beams of light peer through the spaces between the books.

[make your way through a few shelves]

In the heart of the room, you find a plywood board laid across two shelves. 
on it lies a small matress and a few sheets
it's a bed, but it doesn't even qualifiy as a twin. 

there's a book..."the heart is decietful above all things"
a page is bookmarked. (passage about not hiding in a closet)

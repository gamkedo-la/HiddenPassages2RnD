I'm creating a twine story that plays out like this:
Player can search the cubicle of a new intern, called Lexi. 
In different ways they will be able to search through her laptop - discover mini-games, riddles, and other fun stuff.
If there is a cohesive background story of the game , we could hide clues there

currently I am building the branches of the laptop only, but if it's fun I implement more 



NOTE: ENGLISH IS NOT MY FIRST LANGUAGE - PROVE-READING AND CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK IS WELCOME :-D

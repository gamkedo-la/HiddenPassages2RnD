In the folder fbx/table are models that make up the table, the origin points of the models
are all at the same spot (otherwise putting them together would be impossible i guess)

In the folder fbx/preview are the models of the shapes that are made for the
"Preview/what object to find" for the player, since the ones used on the table are cut in to odd shapes.
There origin points are at there center.
